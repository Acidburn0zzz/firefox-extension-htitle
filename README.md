# HTitle

Hide title bar if window is maximized (like GNOME 3).

Please visit extension's page on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/htitle/) for install last stable version. Also, it is good place for you positive reviews. For post bug reports and feature requests please use [issues page](https://github.com/seleznev/firefox-extension-htitle/issues). I read it more often. Code of unstable version is contained in [next branch](https://github.com/seleznev/firefox-extension-htitle/tree/next). Use it for testing only.

_Warning! Don't use HTitle and Hide Caption Titlebar Plus in one time!_
